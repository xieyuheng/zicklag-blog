I think respect is one of the most important, and often neglected concepts, when it comes to how people interact with each-other. I talked a bit about respect in my other post, [The Enemy Lies](./the-enemy-lies), and I'll touch on some of the same ideas here, but I also want to think more specifically about _why_ we respect people.

For example, maybe you meet someone online, in a chatroom or something like that, and find out that they have the same favorite game as you. You hit it off and talk about all these things that you did in the game, and it's cool because it's like the other person "gets it". The shared interest in that game establishes a baseline of mutual respect between you and the other person.

What's interesting to realize is that our respect for someone else tends to naturally stem from something that we _share_. In this case it's a shared interest, but it could really be anything. People might respect others who are from the same country, or the same gender, or the same skin color, or the same political party. If somebody thinks what you think, you'll probably respect their their thoughts on that subject. If somebody is like you in some way, then you might have a certain respect for them because they'll have an _understanding_ of the way that you are.

That doesn't mean that all respect comes from some level of shared thoughts or feelings, but as humans, there's a natural inclination to respect those who are the same as us somehow.

The opposite is also true.

When somebody is _different_ than us, there is often an inclination towards _disrespecting_ that person. People tend to think that what they think is right. If somebody thinks differently than you, then one of you must be wrong. ( Not always but that's often how we feel. ) And who wants to be wrong?

And if somebody is different than you in other ways, they might not understand you. They don't know how you feel and can't relate to you in that way. Beyond that, you don't understand them, and can't relate to many parts of _their_ life. People will often harbor a sense of hostility towards things that they don't understand.

## Internet Groups

The internet has proven an excellent tool for helping people cluster around others with shared thoughts or interests. If you're interested in cooking, you might find a cooking group and learn a lot of great stuff from others who are also cooks. If you're a gamer, you might find a group to discuss strategies or share funny videos of what you did in a specific game. In your group, for the most part, you have something you share with everybody else in the group.

The thing is, we almost never agree with anybody on everything. As soon as you step out of an isolated topic, you could have dramatic disagreements on other topics. Just because you both like the same game, doesn't mean you'll both have the same political values. And there are lots of topics that people take very personally and put great importance on. Some of these people will hate anybody who doesn't agree with them. Many will revile and slander those who think differently. To them, the difference is too great to ever consider respecting the other person as a person.

## Everyone is a Person

But that's what I think a lot of people forget: that everyone is a person. You may have different interests, different skin color, and different political opinions, but you will never meet another person without hopes and dreams, fears and failures. Everybody feels pain. Everybody was born and everybody will die. Absolutely there are differences, but if everybody were the same, we'd only need one person.

Everybody has the remarkable ability to make their own decisions, to have their own agency. And everybody has the right to disagree.

You can respect somebody, _as a person_, even if you _don't_ respect their ideas, opinions, or actions.

I may think that somebody has the worst ideas ever on gardening, but still respect them as a person, who has a right to their own opinion. I can respect somebody's skill as a musician, without respecting how they live their life or the things they advocate for politically.

Just because I don't respect their opinions, or their life decisions, that doesn't mean I treat them as a whole other class of person who isn't entitled to the same fundamental rights.

## Limits of Respect

Just because I respect someone as a person, though, doesn't mean that they have a right to do whatever they want however they want. The guiding principle in many cases is that everybody should be as free as possible without taking away the freedoms of others. Pretty much the [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

For example, if an evil wizard took over your country and enslaved your people, no amount of respect for that wizard as a person would justify allowing him to take away the fredoms of all the other people. You'd stop that wizard if you could.

If that evil wizard thought that he had a right to be an evil wizard and enslave those who were not as strong as him, he has a right to his own opnion, but that doesn't mean he should get away with what he's trying to do!

In fact, the evil wizard is obviously failing to respect the other people. He is taking away their rights as people, and even though we still treat the evil person as a person, they don't get a free pass, and and we must deal with his actions appropriately.
